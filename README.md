**An exploratory data analysis using statistics and data visualisation, and a very basic illustration of how this dataset can be used in machine learning.**


## About the Dataset
![Iris Species](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Machine+Learning+R/iris-machinelearning.png)

The dataset contains: 3 classes (3 different Iris species) with 50 samples each, with four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Attribute to be predicted: Different Species of the Iris plant.

## Machine Learning
This is a supervised learning problem as the example provides both input (iris measurements) and output (iris species) pairs. The information from these pairings should ideally allow us to create a model that can accurately predict a species of iris when presented with new data inputs.

The steps in the construction of a supervised machine learning program are as stated individually below:

1. Data collection.
2. Data preparation.
3. Choose a model.
4. Train the model.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Parameter tuning
7. Make predictions.

 ## Choosing a Model
 Scikit-learn is a popular Python library used for creating machine learning models. There are several algorithms available in this library that can be used to build a machine learning model for the Iris Dataset including:

- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Classification and Regression Trees
- Gaussian Naive Baynes
- Support Vector Models


## Conclusion
The exploratory data analysis performed in this investigation uncovered many intrigiung details about the Iris Dataset. The main points to be noted are:
