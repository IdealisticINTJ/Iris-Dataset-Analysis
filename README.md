**An exploratory data analysis using statistics and data visualisation, and a very basic illustration of how this dataset can be used in machine learning.**

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains: 3 classes (3 different Iris species) with 50 samples each, with four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Attribute to be predicted: Different Species of the Iris plant.
